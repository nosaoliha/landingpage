# The Landing Page Project

This project aims to give real-world scenarios of **manipulating the DOM**. Refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code.

## What You Will Build

A multi-section landing page.

## Project Files

You can obtain the project code by modifying the `js/app.js` file, as well as modifications to the index.html and css/styles.css files to further update and customize your project.
