# Landing Page Project

This project will show you how to **manipulate the DOM** in real-world situations. The feature is used to accomplish two goals:
1. Appending dynamically added data to the DOM.
2. Demonstrating how javascript may improve the usability of a static site.

Use the `.zip` file supplied or visit my [Github Repository](https://github.com/nosaoliha/landingpage.git) to open and view the project.

Github hosts the project as well.

## What You Will Build?

A multi-section landing page.

## Project Files

You can obtain the project code by modifying the `js/app.js` file, as well as modifications to the index.html and `css/styles.css` files to further update and customize your project.

The starter project can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

## Tools Required
No additional tools are required apart from a text-editor of your choice (i would recommend Notepad++).

## Installation
No installation is required for this project

## Instructions
The starter code has an **HTML** and **CSS** files to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You will need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the **HTML** and **CSS** files, but primarily the **JS** file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
